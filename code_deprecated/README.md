# Implementation [Deprecated]

Since we initially planned to implement the paper using MATLAB, two developments have led us to switch gears and move to the new ['code'](https://github.com/msu-ml/17spr_wayman_mathew/tree/master/code) folder:

- Pythons handling of training and testing data saves a lot of time, given that we are synthesizing strings for one segment.
- We were unaware that we could use tools of our choice for this project.

Please look in the ['code'](https://github.com/msu-ml/17spr_wayman_mathew/tree/master/code) folder for our implementation of this paper and other related networks.

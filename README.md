2017 Spring CSE 847 class project repository for Eric Wayman and Adi Mathew

## Proposal ##

We have decided to focus on the fundamentals and theory behind the work done by Ba, et. al. in their paper [**Using Fast Weights to attend to the recent past**](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6057-using-fast-weights-to-attend-to-the-recent-past.pdf), which was published at [NIPS 2016](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6057-using-fast-weights-to-attend-to-the-recent-past).

Our current goal is to study the methods and replicate at least one comparitive test against other methods.
